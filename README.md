# Coss-API-Node
A modular wrapper for the coss.io API written in node.js. Wrapper has been constructed to be modular so that it can be easily developed around and potentially released as a node module that can be required as a dependency for easy development around. For any inquiries about use, please contact James Deal, the developer: @ jimmydeal@gmail.com or on telegram @cryptodeal20
